## About Us

Welcome to the OWASP JECRC University Chapterâ€”a thriving community dedicated to enhancing cybersecurity awareness, fostering innovation, and promoting best practices in the field of information security.

### What is OWASP?

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a global nonprofit organization committed to improving the security of software. OWASP provides resources, tools, and guidelines to help organizations and individuals develop and maintain secure web applications and software systems. Its mission is to make software security visible so that individuals and organizations can make informed decisions about the risks associated with their software projects.
